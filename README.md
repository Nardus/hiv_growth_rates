# Logistic growth regression models applied to HIV transmitted founder and chronic control isolates

Code to fit (and illustrate) the logistic growth models used in Sugrue *et al*. (2021). "The interferon resistance of transmitted HIV-1 is a consequence of enhanced replicative fitness". *Preprint*. [doi:10.1101/2021.12.18.473292](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.18.473292)

- All other dependencies can then be installed using:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

Re-run all analyses using:

```
conda activate hiv_growth_rate
make
```
